Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with BERT

Overview
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The model is trained to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

Features
Fine-tuned BERT model using Hugging Face's Transformers library.
Training and evaluation on the IMDB movie review dataset.
Python scripts for training, evaluation, and inference.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your preferred backend for Transformers)
Hugging Face Transformers library
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/garvkhurana/1st-transformer-Fine-tuning.git
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Training the Model
Download the IMDB movie review dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

Fine-tune the BERT model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Adjust hyperparameters and training configurations as needed in train.py.

Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the trained model:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
This script will evaluate the model on the test set and report metrics like accuracy.
